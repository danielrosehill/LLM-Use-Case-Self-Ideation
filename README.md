# LLM Use-Cases, Self-Ideation

## Repository Contents

### Prompt Outputs

At the time of writing, the prompt outputs are saved as Markdown files (`.md`).

These can be downloaded and read in any Markdown reader. 

Or if you'd like to read them elsewhere, feel free to convert them into whatever format you like best. You could use a [Markdown to Rich Text Convert](https://mconverter.eu/convert/markdown/rtf/) or copy-and-paste the outputs into one.

### Prompt Sections

The various headers used are outlined in `outputsections.md`.

These are subject to change (as I think of sections I would like to add to outputs and those I'd like to remove from previous ones).

Retired/deprecated output sections will be preserved in `Archive`.

### Custom GPT Configuration File

You can see the configuration used to generate these responses which I plan on updating from time to time.

It's in:

`GPT_Config` 

and the iterative versions are ordered sequentially, numerically.

The configuration is in `JSON`. 

### Folder Organisation

To try to keep simlilar outputs together, the outputs may be grouped into folders. 

Given that there's a relatively sharp distinction between personal and professional use-cases for GPTs, I sometimes use folders called `work` or `professional` and `personal` to keep these two sections separate.

Outputs are nested under a parent folder called `Outputs`.

The eventual file structure will be something like this:

```
Outputs
- Subject
-- Use Case Description
```

###  Warning!

The responses are GPT generated and for the most part are not edited/preserved. 

Expect some inaccuracies although for the most part the outputs are quite well structured.
